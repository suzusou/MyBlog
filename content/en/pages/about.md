## Introduction
Hi, I'm Bellfat, and I study mainly web-based technologies.  
Recently, I've been participating in competitive programming and CTF (Capture The Flag), and I've been playing around with Python a lot since I discovered how useful it is.  
I post a technical blog irregularly, so if you have time, please take your time to read it.
